Refactor Ideas
  - must include a hash somewhere
  - make every method have a single responsibility
  - make every class have a single responsibility
  - refactor so we can call night_writer from command line successfully AND call rspec without having to comment out lines
    - probably need to think of night_writer.rb as a runner file, and move functionality to another class that is tested   by rspec
